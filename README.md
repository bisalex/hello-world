# hello-world
My first step into the open world of open-source!
I am an amateur computer scientist and philosopher working from the lower-bounds of the "third world"!Who knows, I may become a professional one day, eh?
I want to work on AI in the near future, as soon as my Java and algorithm skills are ready.
